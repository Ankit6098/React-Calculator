# ðŸ”¢ React Calculator

A React calculator employs a modern tech stack centered around the React library. Leveraging JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, and CSS, developers use React's component-based architecture to create a modular and interactive user interface. Webpack bundles and optimizes the code, while Babel ensures compatibility across browsers. npm or Yarn manage dependencies and Git tracks version control. Testing is facilitated by frameworks like Jest and React Testing Library. ESLint and Prettier maintain code quality, and responsive design is achieved with CSS frameworks or custom media queries. This comprehensive stack ensures efficient development, testing, and deployment of the calculator application, combining the strengths of React with essential tools for a robust user experience.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
